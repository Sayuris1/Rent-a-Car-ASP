# Rent a Car Site Using ASP.Net and MSSQL

A website prepared for BLM4531 course. For detailed information in Turkish, see odev.pdf.


Car_sql.bak is an MSSQL backup file. You can create the database using it. If the site does not automatically recognise your local_server, you may need to edit the connectionString in line 42 of Web.config. Set local_server as DataSource. Make sure you enter it correctly.
